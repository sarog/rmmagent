### Fork of Tactical RMM Agent
This is a fork of `wh1te909/rmmagent` version `1.5.1` with the build scripts imported from `1.4.14` before the [source repo](https://github.com/wh1te909/rmmagent) [deleted them](https://github.com/wh1te909/rmmagent/commit/3fdb2e8c4833e5310840ca79bf394a53f6dbe990).

This `dev` branch is focusing on making the agent on par with 1.7.2 (or latest) features from upstream.

## Project goals
- Re-introduce an open source version of the agent while maintaining compat with the server.
- ~~Make the Python dependency optional.~~ âœ…
- Implement a secure build & delivery system that enforces signature checks, or allows the sysadmin/developer to sign their own builds.
- Backport changes from the upstream project, if possible.

### Differences between upstream and this repo

- The Python binaries are no longer downloaded by default.
  - If Python is desired, it will be possible to install it through [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/python) manually.
  - (todo) Chocolatey will be used to (optionally) install Python in an upcoming release.
  - As a result, new PowerShell commands have replaced the Python scripts in functions `LoggedOnUser()` and `GetCPULoadAvg()`.
- New CLI flag `-windef` allows control over adding Windows Defender exclusions.
  - The default value is `false`, meaning the agent executable & related paths will not be added to Windows Defender's exclusions.
- New CLI flag `-py-enabled` allows control over whether Python installation or execution is allowed.
  - A new Registry value called `PythonEnabled` is created.
  - The default value is `false`, meaning Python will not be downloaded, and `.py` scripts will not execute.
- (todo) Automatic updates from the RMM server will be temporarily disabled for obvious reasons.
- This agent is **unofficial & unsupported**, so don't bother the upstream developers about it (but feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/sarog/rmmagent/issues/new) here).

### What's missing

As of 2022-01-02:
- The CLI flags `-nomesh` and `-meshdir` have not been implemented.
- A few of the Task Scheduler / Automated Tasks functionality is incomplete.

### Building the Windows agent

Pre-requisites:
- Golang 1.17+
- [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) (optional) for distribution

Clone the repository & download the dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/sarog/rmmagent
go mod download
go get github.com/josephspurrier/goversioninfo/cmd/goversioninfo
```

#### Building the 64-bit agent
```
goversioninfo -64
env CGO_ENABLED=0 GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags "-s -w" -o out\agent.exe
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" build\setup.iss
```

#### Building the 32-bit agent
```
goversioninfo
env CGO_ENABLED=0 GOARCH=386 go build -ldflags "-s -w" -o out\agent.exe
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" build\setup-x86.iss
```

### Signing the agent

Requirements:
- A coveted _Code Signing_ certificate, either purchased from a third-party Certificate Authority, or ideally one from your internal Private Key Infrastructure (PKI). If you don't have a PKI, you can self-sign and distribute the public certificate separately.
- Microsoft's key signing tool called [SignTool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/signtool) (part of the Windows 10 SDK) or kSoftware's free [kSign](https://www.ksoftware.net/code-signing-certificates/) if you like GUIs (scroll down to the section titled "Download kSign").

Sign the `agent.exe` and optionally the `winagent-x.y.z.exe` setup file.

The following signing & verification examples are from Microsoft's [SignTool documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/using-signtool-to-sign-a-file).

#### Examples

Sign the agent with your certificate using a SHA256 algorithm:
```shell
signtool sign /f MyCert.pfx /p MyPassword /fd SHA256 agent.exe 
```

Sign and timestamp the agent:
```shell
signtool sign /f MyCert.pfx /t http://timestamp.digicert.com /fd SHA256 agent.exe
```

Timestamp a file after it was signed:
```shell
signtool timestamp /t http://timestamp.digicert.com agent.exe
```

If you already have your CS certificate loaded in your Windows keystore, you can abbreviate to the following:
```shell
# Automatically chooses a CS cert:
signtool sign /a /fd SHA256 agent.exe

# Choose a CS cert based on the subject name "My Certificate":
signtool sign /n "My Certificate" /fd SHA256 agent.exe 
```

Signature verification is quite simple:
```shell
signtool verify agent.exe
```

### Installation and deployment

From the server, choose the 'Manual' method when generating an agent. Copy the command line arguments and pass them to the binary. You can also modify the PowerShell script that's available in the dashboard.

### Updating the agent

Any automatic updates sent by the server will be rejected. A system administrator can still update agents remotely by deploying a custom script/command (instructions to be provided soon).

### Branding your agent

For the time being, it is ill-advised to change any of the branding, unless you know what you are doing. There are plans to centralize such changes in a future release.

If you plan on using this agent with TacticalRMM, avoid changing any of the following identifiers. Doing so will break things (e.g. the agent won't be able to identify itself to the server).
- The names of the two (2) Windows services `tacticalagent` and `tacticalrpc`. However, the service display name & description **can** be changed.
- The `TacticalAgent` folder name in `Program Files`.
- The agent's binary name `tacticalrmm.exe`. Change the `FileDescription` in `versioninfo.json` which is what will show up in Task Manager.
